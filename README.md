# seatselector

This is a simple Java application that simulates an airline reservation system. This was a class project CSIT 112 @ Montclair State University.

## How do I run it? 

##### For IDE's

If you are using some sort of Java IDE (jGrasp, Eclipse, etc.), just  `git clone` the repository and open up the entire folder in your IDE. Compile and run `App.java` to launch the application.

##### For the command line

If you are using the command line to run this project, first `git clone` the repository and then I'm pretty sure you run 

```
java App.java
```

to compile the files, and then 

```
javac App.java
```

to run the project.

Hopefully this work for you and you enjoyed the project. Thanks!
